<!-- IMPORTANT: Below you are associating the link stylesheet with MYSTYLE2.CSS that we have in this folder. This is a code that 
was created in CSS through Adobe Dreamweaver. If you don't have Adobe Dreamweaver, please download it for free from CSUMB. Please google ADOBE CSUMB and download ADOBE 
products (not others - just Adobe Dreamweaver is fine) for free. CSUMB students can login through their CSUMB email address and get that software for
free. The TIGER's background is from that MYSTYLE2.CSS. But for your home purpose (for spring break week), you can just play with INDEX notepad code and ignore MYSTYLE2.CSS -->

          <h1> Early Years</h1>
          <p> 
Initially from Southern California, I come from a small family and was raised by a single father with the help of grandparents. Seeing their hard work and sense of unity in raising me sparked a determination to be successful through diligent and committed work ethic to provide an easier path for my future family. Starting in my early days of school this belief was strongly implemented in me, as I was placed in advanced classes in my time from elementary schooling to high school. In high school I secured my first job at 16 while participating in athletic teams, leaving me to graduate as a student athlete with a 3.45 GPA.
<h1> Education</h1> 
<h2> College</h2>
<p style="float: left"><img src="Comp2.jpg" width="200px" height="200" align="right"> I am currently enrolled as a Business Administration major at California State University Monterey Bay, pursuing a bachelor’s degree in general business. I am set to graduate in May as a part of the Spring 2017 class and will be walking with honors- cum laude. At CSUMB I have taken multiple courses preparing me for the business world through a wide range of topics such as: Finance, Information Systems, Entrepreneurship, Marketing, Management, and eCommerce. These courses have provided information and insight to produce a balanced sense of business knowledge. </p>

          <p> <h1>WORK </h1>
Apart from the skills I have acquired through my time as a business student at CSUMB, I have also gathered real world experience from working multiple jobs. Though my first job in high school did not service my growth as a strong employee in terms of teaching new skills, it did show me the importance of having such skills in order to never work a lower level job again. After graduating high school and transitioning to college, I quickly found new employment. Over the time I have spent in Monterey I have been fortunate enough to secure employment in multiple facets of business such as; hospitality, retail, food, and accounting.

<h1>SERVICE</h1>
Apart from skills I have acquired through working, I have also gathered experience through various service roles I have fulfilled throughout the community. Such experiences have taught me how to communicate with those I have little in common with and would not typically interact with. 
Dorothy’s Kitchen- Homeless shelter: Various roles
Chamberlains Children Center- Foster home: In home mentor
I have also performed various service events through my fraternity, Kappa Sigma, which I have served as Grand Scribe for 2 years- the administrative arm of the chapter that handles all interactions with outside sources along with filing, book keeping, and documentation.

<div class="tab-content">
          <p> Though I have not yet worked in a field I have found true passion in, I am still looking for what fits, knowing that the best work is done for something you enjoy. I have enjoyed working for the companies that I have been employed by, but the majority of industries did not captivate me as needed to dedicate my career to it. The various roles I have served may be unrelated but they did point out which traits reached out to me. With this, I have come to learn I prefer working in environments that keep me moving and thinking, opposed to a desk job filled with a plethora of data entry. Additionally, I have found positions which entailed interacting with others to be more satisfying than those that are conducted independently and separately from others. With knowing what I do and do not like in a work environment, there are specific fields that greatly interest me. Such fields of special interest are professional sports, in the sense I would love to work on the administrative side of a professional sports organization. Additionally, I am fascinated with the idea of working behind the scenes in television production for I appreciate the power television has to occupy and entertain individuals. </p>
